# adventofcode-rb-2016

I'm reluctantly doing [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) again.

I say "reluctantly" because I got dragged into it by a friend midway through last year, and felt the need to follow through.

Despite this, I still intend to compete for fast times on the leaderboards.

All solutions are written in Ruby.

# Input

In general, all solutions can be invoked in both of the following ways:

* Without command-line arguments, takes input on standard input.
* With command-line arguments, reads input from the named files (- indicates standard input).

Some may additionally support other ways:

# Posting schedule and policy

Before I post my day N solution, the day N leaderboard **must** be full.
No exceptions.

Waiting any longer than that seems generally not useful since at that time discussion starts on [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode) anyway.

Solutions posted will be **cleaned-up** versions of code I use to get leaderboard times (if I even succeed in getting them), rather than the exact code used.
This is because the two seek to optimise two different metrics:

* Leaderboard-seeking code is written for (programmer) speed.
* Solutions posted in this repo are written for readability.

# Other years' solutions

The [index](https://github.com/petertseng/adventofcode-common/blob/master/index.md) lists all years/languages I've ever done (or will ever do).
